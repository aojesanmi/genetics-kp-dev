20220629 - questions for david k
Hi David,
The genetics KP team is working to put together a getCreative() server to answer the drug-treats-disease query and 
had a few questions on this effort:
- we want to verify this is OK. I know ARAs were the only targeted services, but our KP pretty close to having it implemented
- who do we contact to be included/registered to respond to the query
- is the disease list that was passed around still in effect? We'll be including all diseases we have data for, but can focus on loading data that is missing
- is tomorrow 06/30 the deadline, or Tuesday 07/05 when testing will start?
Again, if there is anyone else I should be interfacing with about this, please let me know.
I assume the docs on this effort are whatever I can glean from the OPS/workflow and Architecture call agendas
Thanks
