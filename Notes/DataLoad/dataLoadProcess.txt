- todo 
  - look at bioindex list phenotypes api

- new phenotypes
  - get xlsx document
  - load into load schema 
  - pull in ontology id from the production schema 
  - for any without ontology id (so not in system), run script to find best curie
  - load new phenotypes that have curies into production tables

- gene
  - load flat file into load schema
  - delete genes/phenotypes from production schema 
  - load genes/phenotypes edges for genes and phenotypes in the production schema and based on filter pValue

- pathways 
  - load flat file into load schema
  - delete pathways/phenotypes from production schema 
  - load pathways/phenotypes edges for pathways and phenotypes in the production schema and based on filter pValue

- pathway genes 

- cache 
  - run process to build synonyms and descendants of ontologies
